# Introduction

Our goal here is to provide a concise description first and second derivatives
in multiple dimensions, including the chain and product rule.

In particular, we want to discuss applying the multidimensional chain and
product rule to take second-order derivatives, which appear in many
applications and--because they involve tensors of more than two
dimensions (that is, extensions of matrices that involve more than
two indices)--can be hard to think clearly about without clear
conventions.

Throughout, we will refer to functions $f,$ $g,$ and $h$ with
$$
f : \R^k \to \R^n,
$$
$$
g : \R^m \to \R^k.
$$
and
$$
h \doteq f \circ g : \R^m \to \R^n.
$$

# The chain rule for second order derivatives in 1d

Our ultimate goal goal here is to describe the first and second derivatives
$D^2 h$ of $h$ in terms of derivatives of $f$ and $g.$
