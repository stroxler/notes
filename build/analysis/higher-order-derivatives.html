<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Our goal here is to provide a concise description first and second derivatives in multiple dimensions, including the chain and product rule.</p>
<p>In particular, we want to discuss applying the multidimensional chain and product rule to take second-order derivatives, which appear in many applications and--because they involve tensors of more than two dimensions (that is, extensions of matrices that involve more than two indices)--can be hard to think clearly about without clear conventions.</p>
<p>Throughout, we will refer to functions <span class="math">\(f,\)</span> <span class="math">\(g,\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h\)</span> with <span class="math">\[
f : \R^k \to \R^n,
\]</span> <span class="math">\[
g : \R^m \to \R^k,
\]</span> and <span class="math">\[
h \doteq f \circ g : \R^m \to \R^n.
\]</span></p>
<h1 id="the-chain-rule-for-second-order-derivatives-in-1d">The chain rule for second order derivatives in 1d</h1>
<p>Our ultimate goal goal here is to describe the second derivative <span class="math">\(D^2 h\)</span> of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> in terms of derivatives of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g.\)</span></p>
